 ListThis article is a list of things. 


     Most of Club Penguin's mascots and a few other significant characters  
This is a list of characters in Club Penguin. A variety of characters appeared in many different ways, including the Club Penguin Times, PSA Secret Missions, Stage plays, in-game and real-life books, the Club Penguin Magazine, and more. The majority of characters are penguins although puffles are also prominent. There are various other creatures as well, such as crabs, walruses, among others.
Most of the prominent characters were mascots, characters that players could meet in the game during certain events. Meeting a mascot allowed the player to obtain autographed backgrounds, add the mascot to their Friends List, and usually receive a Stamp. These characters were controlled by Club Penguin Staff[1] and could use special  to interact with players.
